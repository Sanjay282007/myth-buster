    <input type="text" id="search" placeholder="Search myths...">
    <div id="myths-list">
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>Agile development is faster than traditional methods</h2>
            <p>Agile focuses on iterative development, which can lead to faster delivery of small increments, but it doesn't necessarily mean the overall project is completed faster.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>More code means better software</h2>
            <p>Quality over quantity. More code can lead to more bugs and maintenance issues. Efficient and clean code is preferable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>Software development is just coding</h2>
            <p>Software development involves planning, designing, testing, and maintenance, not just coding.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>Once the software is built, the job is done</h2>
            <p>Software requires ongoing maintenance, updates, and support after its initial release.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>Software development is a solitary activity</h2>
            <p>Software development often involves teamwork, collaboration, and communication with various stakeholders.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>The latest technology is always the best choice</h2>
            <p>The best technology depends on the specific needs and constraints of the project, not just its novelty.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>Software can be completely bug-free</h2>
            <p>While rigorous testing can minimize bugs, it's nearly impossible to eliminate all bugs in complex software.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>Open source software is not secure</h2>
            <p>Open source software can be very secure, as it is often reviewed by many developers, which can lead to quicker identification and fixing of vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>Adding more developers to a late project will speed it up</h2>
            <p>Known as Brooks' Law, adding more developers to a late project can actually delay it further due to the time required for onboarding and coordination.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>Software performance issues can always be fixed later</h2>
            <p>Performance should be considered from the beginning, as fixing performance issues later can be costly and complex.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>Developers don't need to understand the business domain</h2>
            <p>Understanding the business domain helps developers create software that better meets user needs and business goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>Once a feature is implemented, it doesn't need to be revisited</h2>
            <p>Features may need updates or improvements based on user feedback and changing requirements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>All software projects follow the same development process</h2>
            <p>Different projects may require different methodologies and processes depending on their unique requirements and constraints.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="myth">
            <h2>Software development is just about writing code</h2>
            <p>It also involves planning, designing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the software.</p>
        </div>
